Things that we need to do, feel free to add to this:
    -Photo uploading
        -privacy managment of each photo
        -a browse view that will show all photos you have the ability to see
    -Implementation of sessions
    -user privacy settings
    -ability to have a friend
        -use relational mapping
            -this will be difficult given the way django handles forms.
